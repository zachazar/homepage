        <p class="about__subheader">My name is Zach Azar and Iâ€™m a Full Stack Software Engineer currently seeking employment in San Francisco, CA.</p>
        <p>Originally from Albuquerque, NM, I attended undergrad at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. There I discovered Computer Science and never looked back. After receiving my degree, I worked for a short time in Nashville. I decided to move back to Albuquerque to spend time with family. After working in Albuquerque as a Software Engineer with New Signature, I decided to further my knowledge with a M.S. from the University of Denver.</p>
        <p>Upon defending my thesis, I was approached by a friend with a great startup idea. We founded a company and built a data visualization tool for the restaurant space. Though the startup was short lived, I learned a tremendous amount (including some new technologies like Node.js, AngularJS, and D3).</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking with my girlfriend, longboarding with my little wolf (husky mix), playing soccer, and taking road trips.</p>
